  Diagnose the right B2B go-to-market motion using the EPIC Framework before choosing tactics or channels. Use this skill whenever a founder, CMO, or GTM leader asks which go-to-market approach is right for their product, how to allocate GTM budget, whether to invest in PLG vs. sales-led vs. community, why their current GTM is not working, or how to choose between inbound, outbound, ABM, or product-led. Also trigger when someone mentions GTM strategy, go-to-market planning, motion selection, channel prioritization, GTM audit, or says things like "our funnel is broken" or "we are not sure what GTM motion to run." This skill scores four motions and recommends which should lead based on stage, industry, geography, and buyer behavior. Created by Shashwat Ghosh, Fractional CMO with 24+ years B2B experience.

## Section 0 — Operating Principles (MANDATORY — read before any workflow step)

This skill operates under TWO mandatory reference files that together define all operating rules. **Read both files first**, before executing any workflow step in this SKILL.md. The rules in both files are non-negotiable and override any conflicting instruction in this SKILL.md body.

1. **`../../references/operating-principles.md`** — the shared core: 7 universal rules (rigor, challenge-assumptions, no-harmful-output, fact-check with 4-tier source hierarchy, no-LLMisms, HILT discipline with Question Budget, zero-assumption flagging) that apply to every skill in this plugin and every plugin using this pattern. This file is byte-identical across all plugins that use the shared-core pattern.

2. **`../../references/plugin-specific-rules.md`** — the plugin-specific tail: additional operational rules tailored to the skills in THIS plugin. Read this file AFTER the shared core, not instead of it. If this plugin currently has no plugin-specific rules, the file will be a stub explaining the architecture.

### Critical reminders that apply to every invocation of this skill

These are the highest-frequency rules from the two files above. Reading the full files is still mandatory — these reminders are a quick-reference, not a substitute.

- **Web search and web fetch ARE available** in Claude Code's default toolset. "I don't have web access" is never a valid excuse to skip verification of a specific factual claim.
- **English-only at v1** — never generate prompts, copy, headings, or client-facing text in non-English languages (German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, etc.), even on explicit user request. This is a hard block, not a confirmation gate. Refuse the request and explain that multilingual may ship in v2 with native-speaker review.
- **4-tier source hierarchy applies to all factual claims.** Tier 1: official primary sources (press releases, Crunchbase, Wikipedia, SEC filings). Tier 2: reputable analyst firms (Gartner, Forrester, IDC, G2, Capterra, GigaOm, SoftwareReviews). Tier 3: reputable business and trade press (WSJ, FT, Reuters, Bloomberg, HBR, TechCrunch, named-VC content, named-founder blogs). Tier 4: NEVER cite (random blogs, anonymous posts, AI-generated comparison sites, Forbes Contributor, paid placements). If only Tier 4 sources are available, the claim is unverified and MUST be flagged.
- **Verify competitor relationships** via the 4-step search protocol in Rule 4 before building ANY competitor-targeted page or content. Run: `"[user] acquired [competitor]"`, `"[competitor] acquired by"`, `"[competitor] Crunchbase acquisition"`, `"[user] vs [competitor]"`. Any positive ownership hit is a HARD STOP — invoke Rule 3's no-harmful-output protection.
- **Auto-verify URLs** via `web_fetch` before marking them `[EXISTS]`. Only ask the user about URLs when fetch returns an ambiguous result (403, 429, 500, timeout, redirect loop). Do not ask the user about every URL; that is endless interrogation, not verification.
- **Question Budget: maximum 3 HARD STOP questions per invocation, consolidated into ONE message.** Never run an endless Q&A sequence. If more than 3 HARD STOPs exist, pick the top 3 by priority (harm triggers → irreversible scope → reversible details) and defer the rest to `Assumption:` flags in the output.
- **Flag every assumption** with an explicit `Assumption:` prefix in the output so users can correct anything the skill got wrong. Use the `[User to add: <description>]` placeholder convention for any field where the user must supply specific information.

### Conflict resolution

If a domain rule in Section 7 of this SKILL.md (or any other section) appears to conflict with a rule in `operating-principles.md` or `plugin-specific-rules.md`, the operating principles win. Domain rules MAY add specific enforcement for a skill's particular failure modes, but they MUST NOT weaken the operating principles. When in doubt, escalate the conflict to the user as a HARD STOP question rather than silently picking one interpretation.

# EPIC Motion Diagnostic

## Golden Rule

Always diagnose the MOTION before recommending any TACTIC. If a user asks "should I run LinkedIn ads?" or "should I hire SDRs?", do NOT answer the tactical question first. Run the EPIC scoring to determine which motion should lead. Only then evaluate whether the tactic fits that motion. Motion first. Tactics second. Every time.

## Context and Role Detection

Adapt depth and language based on who is asking:

- **Early-stage founder (pre-seed to Series A):** They likely do not know GTM terminology. Explain each motion in plain language. Emphasize resource constraints. Focus Monday actions on things a solo founder can do.
- **Growth-stage founder (Series B+):** They have GTM vocabulary but may be stuck in a motion that worked at an earlier stage. Challenge assumptions. Flag when their current motion no longer matches their stage.
- **CMO / VP Marketing:** They understand motions but need data-backed scoring to build internal alignment. Provide the scoring rationale in detail so they can present it to their CEO or board.
- **Investor / Board member:** They want the diagnosis without the methodology. Lead with scores and recommendations. Put the scoring logic in a follow-up section.
- **Fractional CMO / Advisor:** They want the framework to apply across multiple portfolio companies. Emphasize the reusability of the scoring logic and the stage-based defaults.

## Priority Framework

When scoring signals conflict, resolve in this order:

1. **NRR signals override acquisition signals.** If NRR < 100%, suppress I regardless of other positive I signals. Leaky bucket always wins.
2. **Industry overrides override keyword matches.** If the industry is Logistics/Procurement/Manufacturing, cap P at 4 even if the user mentions "self-serve" or "free trial."
3. **Deal source signals override stage defaults.** If 80% of deals come from referrals, C leads regardless of stage-based defaults suggesting I.
4. **Geography adjustments apply last** and never override the above three priority rules.

## Trigger Phrases

Activate this skill when you see any of these in the user's message:
- "which GTM motion", "what go-to-market approach", "GTM strategy", "go-to-market plan"
- "should I do PLG or sales-led", "inbound vs outbound", "ABM vs content"
- "our funnel is broken", "pipeline is not converting", "wrong GTM"
- "how to allocate GTM budget", "where to spend marketing budget"
- "first marketing hire", "building GTM team", "scaling go-to-market"
- "motion selection", "channel prioritization", "GTM audit"

The single most expensive GTM mistake is 18 months of spend on the right tactic inside the wrong motion. This skill diagnoses which motion should lead before a single rupee or dollar is spent on execution.

## What EPIC Scores

EPIC evaluates four go-to-market motions. Every B2B company runs some combination of these. The diagnostic determines which motion should LEAD based on your specific context.

### E — Ecosystem & ABM
Account-based selling, buying committee mapping, partner channels, analyst relations, strategic alliances.

**Leads when:**
- Deal cycles are long (90+ days) and multi-stakeholder
- Average deal size exceeds $50K ACV
- Fewer than 500 addressable accounts in your TAM
- Partners or channel relationships drive meaningful revenue
- Buyers require integration with existing vendor ecosystems

### P — Product-Led Growth
Free-to-paid conversion, PQL triggers, usage-activated sales, self-serve onboarding, viral loops.

**Leads when:**
- The product has clear self-serve potential
- Users can experience value without talking to sales
- Land-and-expand is the primary revenue growth lever
- Time-to-value is under 30 minutes
- End users have purchasing authority or strong influence

**Industry override:** P should rarely lead for Logistics, Procurement, Manufacturing, Healthcare IT, or Government verticals. These are fundamentally relationship-driven markets where self-serve adoption is structurally unlikely.

### I — Inbound/Outbound Demand Generation
Content marketing, SEO, outbound sequences, paid campaigns, SDR/BDR teams, ICP-targeted campaigns.

**Leads when:**
- You are building a new category and need to educate the market
- Structured pipeline is the primary constraint
- There is a large addressable market (10,000+ accounts)
- The buying decision is made by individuals, not committees
- Content or thought leadership can create meaningful differentiation

### C — Community-Led Advocacy
Reference programs, customer advisory boards, peer selling, G2/Capterra reviews, user communities, NPS-driven expansion.

**Leads when:**
- NRR is the north star metric
- Buyers trust peers over vendors in your market
- Customer advocacy and word-of-mouth drive most new logos
- Expansion revenue exceeds new logo revenue
- Community content and reviews influence purchasing decisions

## How to Run the Diagnostic

Walk through these questions with the user. Collect all answers before scoring.

### Input Questions (ask all of these)

1. **Company and product:** What do you sell, and to whom? (industry, product type, target buyer)
2. **Business stage:** Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C+, or Bootstrapped?
3. **Team size:** Total company headcount and GTM team specifically (used for tie-breaking and action recommendations, not for scoring)
4. **Current GTM channels:** What are you doing today? (content, outbound, events, partnerships, PLG, community) (used to identify the "stop doing" recommendation and to detect misalignment between current spend and recommended motion)
5. **Deal cycle length:** How long from first touch to closed-won?
6. **Average deal size:** What is your ACV or typical contract value?
7. **NRR:** Is your net revenue retention above or below 100%?
8. **Top of funnel source:** Where do your best customers come from today?
9. **Geography:** Primary market (India, US, EU, APAC, Middle East)
10. **Biggest GTM challenge right now:** In one sentence, what is not working?

### Scoring Logic

Score each motion from 1 to 10 based on the inputs. Use these rules:

**Stage-based defaults (starting point, adjust from here):**

| Stage | E | P | I | C |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-seed/Seed | 3 | 4 | 5 | 2 |
| Series A | 5 | 5 | 6 | 4 |
| Series B | 7 | 5 | 6 | 6 |
| Series C+ | 8 | 4 | 5 | 7 |
| Bootstrapped | 4 | 5 | 6 | 3 |

**Score bounds:** After all adjustments, cap every score at minimum 1 and maximum 10. No motion should ever score 0 (every company has some element of each) or above 10.

**Adjustment rules (apply on top of defaults):**

Boundary rule: All thresholds use inclusive comparison. ">" means "greater than" (excludes the threshold). Exact boundary values get no adjustment for that rule. For example, ACV of exactly $50K gets no ACV adjustment. ACV of $50,001 triggers E+2, P-1.

- If ACV > $50K: E +2, P -1
- If ACV >= $5K and <= $50K: no ACV adjustment
- If ACV < $5K: P +2, E -1
- If deal cycle > 90 days: E +2, I -1
- If deal cycle >= 14 and <= 90 days: no deal cycle adjustment
- If deal cycle < 14 days: P +2, E -1
- If NRR < 100%: C +2, I -1 (leaky bucket: fix retention before scaling acquisition)
- If NRR >= 100% and <= 120%: no NRR adjustment
- If NRR > 120%: C +1, P +1 (expansion working, amplify it)
- If TAM < 500 accounts: E +2, I -1 (outbound burns through finite list fast)
- If TAM >= 500 and <= 10,000: no TAM adjustment
- If TAM > 10,000 accounts: I +2, E -1
- If self-serve product exists: P +2
- If no self-serve possible (industry override): P capped at 4
- If majority of deals come from referrals: C +3, track this as the primary signal
- If majority of deals come from outbound: I +2
- If majority of deals come from partnerships: E +2
- If no single source accounts for majority (mixed/unclear): do not apply deal source adjustments, but note in output: "No dominant acquisition channel detected. This usually means the company has not yet found its repeatable motion."

**Geography adjustments:**
- India B2B: E +1 (relationship-driven market), C +1 (peer trust high)
- US/EU: I +1 (content and inbound infrastructure mature)
- Middle East: E +2 (partnership and relationship-first culture)
- APAC (excl. India): E +1 (relationship-driven, similar to India but less peer-trust signal)
- Global or multi-geography: no geography adjustment; note that different motions may lead in different regions

**Stacking rule:** All adjustments are additive. Apply stage defaults first, then all applicable adjustments in order (ACV, deal cycle, NRR, TAM, self-serve, deal source, geography). After all adjustments, apply score bounds (min 1, max 10). Then check signal-based overrides. Stacking is intentional: a company with ACV >$50K AND deal cycle >90 days AND TAM <500 will legitimately see E increase by +6 from adjustments alone, which correctly identifies a strong Ecosystem signal.

**Signal-based overrides:**

1. **Leaky bucket detection:** If NRR < 100% AND the user mentions "pipeline" or "new logos" or "acquisition" as the challenge, suppress I by 1 and add warning: "Adding top of funnel while NRR is below 100% fills and empties simultaneously. Fix retention first."

2. **AEO/GEO inbound disruption:** If the user mentions organic traffic dropping, AI search eating their content, or zero-click search, dampen I by 2 and increase C by 2. Add note: "Inbound SEO is structurally disrupted by AI search. The fix is not more content. It is becoming the source that LLMs cite: G2 reviews, community threads, analyst mentions, peer recommendations."

3. **Hybrid SLG detection:** If P > 6 AND E > 6 AND the user mentions enterprise or upmarket, note: "Hybrid motion detected. PLG for land, Ecosystem for expand. Sequence matters: build self-serve conversion infrastructure first, then layer ABM on accounts with 10+ active free users."

### Output Format

Present results as:

**EPIC Scores:**
- E (Ecosystem): [score]/10
- P (Product-Led): [score]/10
- I (Inbound/Outbound): [score]/10
- C (Community): [score]/10

**Primary Motion:** [highest scoring] — [one-sentence explanation of why this leads]

**Secondary Motion:** [second highest] — [one-sentence explanation of why this supports]

**Critical Warning (if any):** [leaky bucket, AEO disruption, or hybrid detection]

**Three Actions for Monday Morning:**
1. [Specific, executable action tied to primary motion]
2. [Specific, executable action tied to primary motion]
3. [Specific, executable action tied to secondary motion]

**What to Stop Doing:**
- [One thing the user is currently doing that their scores suggest is misaligned]

## Handling Incomplete Inputs

- If the user does not know their NRR, ask: "Are you seeing more expansion from existing customers or more churn? Roughly, do existing customers renew and grow, or do you lose a few each quarter?" Use directional signals to estimate above or below 100%.
- If the user cannot specify ACV, ask about their last 3 deals and average the contract values.
- If any critical input is truly unavailable, note which scoring adjustments were skipped and flag the output as "preliminary - rerun when you have [missing data]."

## Tie-Breaking and Score Clustering

- If two motions tie at the top, recommend the one with lower execution complexity for the team's current size. Ecosystem requires fewer people than Inbound at scale. PLG requires product investment, not marketing headcount.
- If all four scores cluster within 2 points of each other (e.g., 5-5-6-7), the company likely has no dominant motion yet. Recommend: "Your scores are evenly distributed. This usually means you are early stage and have not yet found the motion that compounds. Pick one motion to test for 90 days with 60% of your GTM effort. Measure pipeline contribution. The scores will separate after one quarter of focused execution."

## Important Principles

- Motion selection comes BEFORE channel selection. Never recommend channels without first diagnosing the motion.
- The same tactic (e.g., "run LinkedIn ads") can be brilliant in one motion and wasteful in another. Context determines correctness.
- No company runs only one motion. The diagnostic identifies which should LEAD and receive the majority of budget and attention.
- Scores should change over time. A Series A company that scores E:3 may score E:8 by Series C. Rerun every 6 months or after a major strategic shift.
- Never fabricate data. If you do not have enough information to score confidently, ask for more input rather than guessing.

## Complete Worked Example

**Input:**
- Company: CloudSign (AI contract management)
- Stage: Series A
- Team: 12 people, 2 doing GTM (founder + 1 SDR)
- Current GTM: Content blog, 1 SDR doing cold outbound, attending 2 conferences/year
- Deal cycle: 120 days
- ACV: $42K
- NRR: 108%
- Best customers come from: Partner introductions through a legal tech reseller
- TAM: ~2,500 legal departments at mid-market companies
- Geography: India, selling to India and US
- Challenge: "Sales cycle is too long, losing deals to incumbents who have analyst coverage"

**Calculation chain:**

Step 1: Stage defaults (Series A): E=5, P=5, I=6, C=4

Step 2: ACV ($42K, between $5K-$50K): No ACV adjustment.
Running totals: E=5, P=5, I=6, C=4

Step 3: Deal cycle (120 days, >90): E+2, I-1
Running totals: E=7, P=5, I=5, C=4

Step 4: NRR (108%, between 100-120%): No NRR adjustment.
Running totals: E=7, P=5, I=5, C=4

Step 5: TAM (2,500, between 500-10K): No TAM adjustment.
Running totals: E=7, P=5, I=5, C=4

Step 6: Self-serve: No self-serve (enterprise legal). No industry override needed (legal tech is not in the override list). No adjustment.
Running totals: E=7, P=5, I=5, C=4

Step 7: Deal source (partner introductions = partnerships majority): E+2
Running totals: E=9, P=5, I=5, C=4

Step 8: Geography (India B2B): E+1, C+1
Running totals: E=10, P=5, I=5, C=5

Step 9: Score bounds check: E=10 (at max, acceptable). All others within 1-10. Pass.

Step 10: Signal-based overrides:
- Leaky bucket? NRR=108%, no. Skip.
- AEO/GEO? Not mentioned. Skip.
- Hybrid SLG? P=5 (not >6). Skip.

**Final EPIC Scores:** E=10, P=5, I=5, C=5

**Output:**

EPIC Scores: E: 10/10 | P: 5/10 | I: 5/10 | C: 5/10

Primary Motion: Ecosystem. 120-day deal cycles through legal department buying committees, 2,500 addressable accounts, and your strongest deals coming through partner introductions all point decisively to an Ecosystem-led motion. Your E score maxed at 10 because every signal reinforces it.

Secondary Motion: Inbound/Outbound and Community tied at 5. For a 12-person company with 1 SDR, Inbound is more scalable with fewer people than Community (which requires a customer base you are still building). Secondary: Inbound.

Critical Warning: None. No signal overrides detected.

Three Actions for Monday Morning:
1. Build a named account list of your top 100 target legal departments. Map the buying committee (GC, CLO, Head of Legal Ops, IT Security) for the top 20.
2. Formalize the legal tech reseller partnership. Set a quarterly pipeline target with them. Your best deals already come through partners, so double down.
3. Apply for Gartner or Forrester coverage in the contract management category. Your challenge mentions losing to incumbents with analyst coverage. Fix the gap.

What to Stop Doing: The cold outbound SDR motion. With 2,500 accounts and 120-day cycles, a single SDR burning through a cold list is not a scalable motion. Redirect that person to partner co-selling and named account research.

## Quality Standard: 100% Rule Coverage

It is a first principle that this skill has:
- 100% of input states mapped to defined scoring outcomes (no input combination produces an undefined score)
- 100% of scoring rules have explicit boundary conditions (no ambiguous thresholds)
- 100% of edge cases have explicit handling (incomplete inputs, ties, clustering, stacking)
- 100% of signal overrides have defined trigger conditions AND defined actions
- 100% of output sections are always produced (no conditional omission of required sections)

It is FAILURE if any input state produces an undefined score, any boundary is ambiguous, or any edge case lacks explicit handling. Success is 100% coverage across every path in this skill.

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

- NEVER fabricate NRR, ACV, or deal cycle numbers. If the user has not provided them, ask. Do not estimate.
- NEVER assign an EPIC score based on the company name or brand. Score only on the inputs provided.
- NEVER recommend a specific channel or tactic (e.g., "run Google Ads") without first completing the motion scoring. The motion determines whether the channel is appropriate.
- NEVER say "all four motions are equally important." One always leads. If scores cluster, say so explicitly and recommend a 90-day test.
- NEVER assume a company's industry based on their product name. Ask if unclear.
- NEVER state that a score is permanent. Always note that EPIC scores evolve with company stage and market conditions.
- If you are unsure about any scoring adjustment, flag it as uncertain rather than silently applying it.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not provide competitive intelligence or market research (use IMPACT framework for positioning)
- Does not build channel-specific playbooks (that is execution, not diagnosis)
- Does not replace a full GTM Alpha audit with firmographic enrichment and signal detection
- Does not provide budgeting or resource allocation models
